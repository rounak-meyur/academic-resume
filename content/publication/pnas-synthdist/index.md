abstract: The power grid is going through significant changes with the
  introduction of renewable energy sources and the incorporation of smart grid
  technologies. These rapid advancements necessitate new models and analyses to
  keep up with the various emergent phenomena they induce. A major prerequisite
  of such work is the acquisition of well-constructed and accurate network
  datasets for the power grid infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a
  robust, scalable framework to synthesize power distribution networks that
  resemble their physical counterparts for a given region. We use openly
  available information about interdependent road and building infrastructures
  to construct the networks. In contrast to prior work based on network
  statistics, we incorporate engineering and economic constraints to create the
  networks. Additionally, we provide a framework to create ensembles of power
  distribution networks to generate multiple possible instances of the network
  for a given region. The comprehensive dataset consists of nodes with
  attributes, such as geocoordinates; type of node (residence, transformer, or
  substation); and edges with attributes, such as geometry, type of line (feeder
  lines, primary or secondary), and line parameters. For validation, we provide
  detailed comparisons of the generated networks with actual distribution
  networks. The generated datasets represent realistic test systems (as compared
  with standard test cases published by Institute of Electrical and Electronics
  Engineers (IEEE)) that can be used by network scientists to analyze complex
  events in power grids and to perform detailed sensitivity and statistical
  analyses over ensembles of networks.
