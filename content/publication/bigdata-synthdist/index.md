abstract: It is well known that physical interdependencies exist between
  networked civil infrastructures such as transportation and power system
  networks. In order to analyze complex nonlinear correlations between such
  networks, datasets pertaining to such real infrastructures are required.
  However, such data are not readily available due to their proprietary nature.
  This work proposes a methodology to generate realistic synthetic power
  distribution networks for a given geographical region. A network generated in
  this manner is not the actual distribution system, but its functionality is
  very similar to the real distribution network. The synthetic network connects
  high voltage substations to individual residential consumers through primary
  and secondary distribution networks. Here, the distribution network is
  generated by solving an optimization problem which minimizes the overall
  length of the network subject to structural and power flow constraints. This
  work also incorporates identification of long high voltage feeders originating
  from substations and connecting remotely situated customers in rural
  geographic locations while maintaining voltage regulation within acceptable
  limits. The proposed methodology is applied to the state of Virginia and
  creates synthetic distribution networks which are validated by comparing them
  to actual power distribution networks at the same location.
