abstract: The power grid is going through significant changes with the
  introduction of renewable energy sources and incorporation of smart grid
  technologies. These rapid advancements necessitate new models and analyses to
  keep up with the various emergent phenomena they induce. At the same time,
  these need to resemble the actual power system model and dynamics. In this
  dissertation, I propose two frameworks -- (i) for constructing synthetic power
  distribution networks for a given geographic region which closely resembles
  the actual physical counterpart, and (ii) for performing cascading failure
  analysis in the power grid when subjected to a severe disturbance, such that
  it resembles the actual power grid events as closely as possible. For the
  first framework, I use openly available information about interdependent road
  and building infrastructures and incorporate engineering and economic
  constraints to construct the distribution networks. The networks synthesized
  by this framework represent realistic power distribution systems that can be
  used by network scientists to analyze complex events in power grids. The
  second framework for cascading failure analysis uses a realistic
  representation of the underlying power grid, including the topology, the
  control and protection components and a dynamic stability analysis that goes
  beyond traditional work consisting of structural and linear flow analysis. The
  proposed framework can be used to assess vulnerability of the power grid to
  any disturbance like a physical attack, cyber attack or any severe weather
  event. Particularly, I consider the case of a targeted physical attack on the
  power grid of Washington DC. The results show that realistic representations
  and analysis can lead to fundamentally new insights that are not possible by
  using simplified models.
