I am a final year PhD candidate in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of University of Virginia. 
I work as a research assistant in the Biocomplexity Institute under the supervision of Dr. Madhav Marathe. 
My research includes modeling and analysis of power grid networks and power grid events as realistically as possible. 
I develop models and frameworks which enable scalable analysis of energy policy questions.
