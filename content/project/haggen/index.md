title: Hybrid Attack Graphs for Cyber-Physical System Resilience
date: 2024-04-29T16:57:55.336Z
summary: "This work generates hybrid attack graphs to represent adversarial attacks on cyber-physical systems such as the power grid using open source information available in MITRE ATT&CK. We use the attacks to formulate optimal mitigation methods to minimize adversarial risk and allocate budget to improve mitigation efficacy, so as to prevent adversarial techniques particular to the attack graphs."
