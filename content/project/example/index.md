summary: This project deals with methods and frameworks to generate synthetic
  digital duplicates of power distribution networks for a geographic region. The
  actual power distribution networks are considered as proprietary information
  and hence not openly available to be used. We develop a framework to create
  power distribution networks and validate them with actual physical
  counterparts. We use these created networks to address different policy level
  problems to promote net zero carbon technologies.
