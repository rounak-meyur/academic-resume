title: Cascading failures in power grid
date: 2022-11-29T16:57:55.336Z
summary: "Cascading events in power grid are extremely complex phenomena involving non-linear characteristics of multi-layered system elements and stochastic behavior of protection and control entities. Approximate linearized failure models, though computationally tractable, comes at a price of reduced accuracy to represent the real sequence of events. Here we provide a framework for cascading failure analysis with complete non-linear dynamic models and realistic representation of control and protection devices to better understand system behavior when subjected to a catastrophic initiating event. Such a framework would aid policymakers to allocate budgets effectively to strengthen the energy infrastructure."
